## Plan
**Step 1/3: Create a vibrant, electrifying community where everybody helps each other**
This will involve an open-source, experimental prototype that drastically increases learning efficiency. It will also involve creating a system where, no matter how behind anyone feels, they'd know that there is an army of classmates and TAs who would jump at the opportunity to help out.
